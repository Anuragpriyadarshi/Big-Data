Mapreduce === Hive

Hive is not much Customizable (Back end Mapreduce)
Mapreduce is a damn (Very Complex)
Mapreduce started showing Huge time for large data processing
Mapreduce cannot support Streaming
I cannot support Machine learning
I am a java GUY
I dont Support SQL ( Run java Code )
I cannot handle semi structured Data easily
I cannot integrate much with Other environment Cloud

Why Spark is popular and Successful ?

1) Spark is Faster than mapreduce
2) Spark is Customizable
3) Spark is not only java also scala,Python,R
4) Spark is an inmemory processing Tool (RAM Processing)
5) Spark is environment Independent (Windows,Linux,HDFS,s3,Google FS,blob)
6) Spark has a very good Cloud Support
7) Spark can be handled with SQL queries ( Powerful )
8) Spark supports Machine learning 
9) Spark supports Streaming as well
10) Spark uses a single Formulae to integrate with many systems

WindowsFS,Linux,Hive,Mongo,Hbase,aws s3,blob storage,Kafka,Cassandra,RabbitMQ,Elastic Search,Mysql

11) Read and Writes  --- GET DO PUT  ---- GET-- SQOOP ----- Do -- hive --- PUT-- SQOOP

GET ---   DO   ---- PUT ----- Spark

11) Spark can process complex data in a single Line
