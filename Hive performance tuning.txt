Hive performance

1) Hive Partitions
2) Map Side Join
3) Vectorization

	set hive.vectorized.execution.enabled= true;
	Usually Hive process one row at a time if u enable vectorization it would process 1024 Rows at a time
	but kills lot of RAM memory

4) Parallel Execution
	set hive.exec.parallel=true;

5) Using TEZ  Engine (Not in Cloudera, Only Horton Works)
	set hive.execution.engine = tez;

6) Hive bucketing -- Join 

	Partitions --- Folder creation --- ParittionedBy
	Bucketing  --- File Creation --- clustered by (id) into 2 Bucketing
